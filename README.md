# NeuraLite: Only Numpy and Maths
### NeuraLite a alternative to Neural Networks (Just Kidding XD), even a small Neural Net requres higher configurations like CUDA or ROCm and ZLUDA, a minimum 16GB of RAM. But if you use a simple logistic regression algorithm for doing such classification tasks that will be much efficient. My goal was not about defaming Neural Net, that would be stupidity, I only tried to see the limits of classical Machine Learning algorithms

## Performance: If you use Neural Nets will get close to 100% accurate results, but in my case I got 90% accuracy after hours of training ang tuning hyperparameters

## Challenges: As I did not use any Machine Learning frameworks like Sklearn or Tensorflow it was much harder to implement those maths equations, I used Numpy for that so my workflow was mostly smooth.

## Thoughts: I don't recommed anyone to write math equations from scratch in production, it is so inefficient to find the best model over and over and tweak the hyperparameters. But for practicing your learning it's helpful and quite fun.
